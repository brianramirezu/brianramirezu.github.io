<center><b><p style="background-color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">I am from Atlanta GA but originaly I was born in Mexico City. After fouteen years I come back home to Mexico City seeking new oportunities.
Back in the U.S I was a welder for a profession but always had a thing for computers and I found Holacode here in Mexico City. I was really
glad when i found this program because they gave me the opportunity to learn something I had always been curious about. Hoping
to graduate in a few months and have a life changing experince. Thank you Holacode.</p></b><center>
